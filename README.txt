Spreadsheet Feature:
ArrayList is used for dataSturcture of Students and Courses 
It makes time complexity for accessing pertucular element O(1) and 
space complexity is less for iteration compared to other datastructure which don't provide indexed access to its elements (Creating Iterator object to access each node increases space complexity)

Three ThreadGroups are used for allocating preference courses, add drop courses and print to files

This project uses Observer Pattern. The twist is the Cell class acts as both Subject and Observer.
